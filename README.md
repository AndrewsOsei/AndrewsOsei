- ⚡ Fun fact: As a Senior Process Metallurgist, you don’t just extract precious metals—you model and predict how they are going to be! With expertise in technical data reporting and forecasting, you’re basically the fortune teller and a magician in the eyes of mining engineer and geologist, foreseeing the processing challenges and dynamics some ores and processing constraints presents before anyone else sees the cracks.
